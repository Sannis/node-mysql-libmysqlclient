Node-mysql-libmysqlclient [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient)
=========================

Asynchronous MySQL binding for [Node.js] using libmysqlclient.  
This module tested with Node.js versions 0.4.12, 0.6.18 and 0.7.8.

[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/


Overview
--------

This bindings provides all general connection/querying functions from MySQL C API,
and part of prepared statements support. `Connect`, `query` and `fetchAll` are asynchronous.
This module also includes experimental support for asynchronous `querySend` from internals of `libmysqlclient`.

I start this project in 2010 when Node.js is growing and Ryan had plans to write this binding as part of [GSoC].
Now it is used by many projects and have more than 10 contributors,
listed in [AUTHORS](https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/blob/master/AUTHORS) file.
I am also maintaining [Node.js MySQL bindings benchmark] that shows great performance of this module.

Node-mysql-libmysqlclient source code is available in the [Github repo] and you can place issues at the project tracker.
Visit [module site] for API docs and examples. Also you can read some extra information in [wiki].

Dependencies
------------

To build this module you must install libmysqlclient library and development files for it.  
`mysql_config` is used to determine the paths to the library and header files.  
To install these dependencies, you can use the command shell.

For CentOS:

    #> yum install mysql-devel

For openSUSE:

    #> zypper install libmysqlclient-devel

For Debian/Ubuntu:

    #> apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

Yes, you would use aptitude if you want.

Please refer to your system documentation on oner systems and feel free to send me a patch for this readme. 


Installation
------------

You can install this module via NPM:

    $> npm install mysql-libmysqlclient

Also you can build latest source code from repository. This way is described in developers documentation.
