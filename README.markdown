###### Asynchronous MySQL binding for [Node.js] using libmysqlclient. ######
__(This module has been tested with Node.js versions 0.4.12, 0.6.19 and 0.7.9.)__

[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/


Overview
--------

These bindings provides all general connection/querying functions from the MySQL C API,
and partial support for prepared statements. `Connect`, `query` and `fetchAll` are asynchronous.
This module also includes experimental support for asynchronous `querySend` from internals of `libmysqlclient`.

I started this project in 2010 when Node.js was growing. Ryan had plans to write this binding as part of [GSoC].
It is now used by many projects and has more than 10 contributors,
who are listed in the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/blob/master/AUTHORS) file.
I also maintain the [Node.js MySQL bindings benchmark] which shows how mysql-libmysqlclient performs.

Node-mysql-libmysqlclient's source code is available in the [Github repo] and you can report issues at the project tracker.
Visit the [module site] for API docs and examples. You can also read some extra information in [wiki].
